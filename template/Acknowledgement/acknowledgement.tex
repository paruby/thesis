This thesis is the culmination of many years of study, during which time I have been blessed to have interacted with numerous outstanding people.
I thank my supervisors Carl Edward Rasmussen and Bernhard Sch\"olkopf, without whose trust I would not have taken the long journey leading to this work.
Ilya Tolstikhin has been a friend and mentor and has guided me through both the ups and downs of the PhD and I thank him for the support, encouragement, feedback and advice he has given me throughout. He has been a role model both within research and without, and I am eternally grateful.
Joris Mooij gave me valuable supervision early in my PhD, and I learned a great deal through my collaboration with him and Stephan Bongers.
Sebastian Weichwald was an excellent collaborator who showed me how productive and satisfying a close collaboration can be, and that digging deep into a topic is best done with company. I thank him and Anna Weininger f\"ur deren Geduld, als ich nach T\"ubingen umgezogen bin und kaum Deustch konnte.
Luigi Gresele confirmed again that close collaborations are the most enjoyable and productive, and I learned a great deal from him, as well as from all of my other collaborators:
Josip Djolonga, Carlos Riquelme, Olivier Bousquet, Arash Mehrjou, Francesco Locatello, Dominik Janzing, Moritz Grosse-Wentrup, Philipp Hennig, Dominik Roblek, Yunpeng Li, Sylvain Gelly, Michael Tschannen, Mario Lucic and Julius von K\"ugelgen.

There are also many people with whom I have not collaborated, but have nonetheless enriched my life during my PhD.
I thank Nilesh Tripuraneni, James Heald, Hannah Sheahan, Mohsen Sadhegi, Matej Balog, Mark van der Wilk and the rest of CBL, who made my time in Cambridge memorable.
From the MPI in T\"ubingen, I thank Mateo Rojas-Carulla, Eduardo PÃ©rez-Pellitero, Diego Agudelo-Espa\~{n}a, Sebastian Gomez-Gonzalez, Dieter B\"uchler, Niki Kilbertus, Giambattista Parascandolo, John Bradshaw, Alessandro Ialongo, Alex Neitz, Matthias Bauer, Adam Scibior, Jonas K\"ubler and the rest of the team. 

Magda has made me a better person, and I thank her for supporting me at all times, particularly during my time in Zurich.
Finally, I thank Mum, Dad, Josh and the rest of my family who give me a solid foundation based on unconditional love.
