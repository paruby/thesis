\subsection{Elaboration of Section \ref{subsection:discussion-assumptions}: satisfaction of assumptions of theorems}\label{appendix:discussion-constraints}

Suppose that ${P_Z}$ is  ${\mathcal{N}\left(0, I_d\right)}$ and ${Q_{Z|X}}$ is  ${\mathcal{N}\left( \mu(X), \Sigma(X)\right)}$ with $\Sigma$ diagonal. 
Suppose further that there exist constants $K, \epsilon > 0$ such that ${\| \mu(X)\| \leq K}$ and ${\Sigma_{ii}(X) \in [\epsilon, 1]}$ for all $i$.

By Lemma~\ref{lemma:chi-squared-closed-form}, it holds that $\chi^2\bigl( Q_{Z|x}, P_Z\bigr) < \infty$ for all $x\in\mathcal{X}$. 
By compactness of the sets in which $\mu(X)$ and $\Sigma(X)$ take value, it follows that there exists $C<\infty$ such that $\chi^2\bigl( Q_{Z|x}, P_Z\bigr) \leq C$ and thus the setting of Theorem~\ref{thm:concentration} holds.

A similar argument based on compactness shows that the density ratio is uniformly bounded in $z$ and $x$: $q(z|x)/p(z) \leq C'$ for some $C'<\infty$. 
It therefore follows that the condition of Theorem~\ref{thm:convergence-rate-general} holds: $\int q^4(z|x)/p^4(z) dP(z) < {C'}^4 < \infty$.

We conjecture that the strong boundedness assumptions on $\mu(X)$ and $\Sigma(X)$ also imply the setting of Theorem~\ref{thm:fast-KL-rate} $\E_{X}\bigl[\chi^2\bigl(Q_{Z|X}, Q_Z\bigr)\bigr] < \infty$.
Since the divergence $Q_Z$ explicitly depends on the data distribution, this is more difficult to verify than the conditions of Theorems~\ref{thm:convergence-rate-general} and \ref{thm:concentration}.

The crude upper bound provided by convexity
\[
\E_{X}\bigl[\chi^2\bigl(Q_{Z|X}, Q_Z\bigr)\bigr] \leq  \E_{X}\E_{X'}\bigl[\chi^2\bigl(Q_{Z|X}, Q_{Z|X'}\bigr)\bigr]
\]
provides a sufficient (but very strong) set of assumptions under which it holds. 
Finiteness of the right hand side above would be implied, for instance, by demanding that ${\| \mu(X)\| \leq K}$ and ${\Sigma_{ii}(X) \in [\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon, 1]}$ for all $i$.
